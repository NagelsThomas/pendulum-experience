## About this app
The pendulum experience is an application made on the [VIKTOR Platform](https://www.viktor.ai/) in order to teach system engineers about state space models. 
There are two parts to the app, the first shows a pendulum being balanced towards a target location. The second aims to stand a double pendulum upright at a certain location.

The app is inspired and based on the code of  [Prof John Hedengren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hedengren/) and the [Gekko Optimisation Suit](https://gekko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
